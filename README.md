# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
This project allows a user to enter reminders throughout their 9-5 work day. The current day and year is displayed at the top of the page. The grey is the past, red the present, and green is the future. Depending on the time of day, the present time will change accordingly.

## Installation
To access the web page, naviagte to the index.html file and open it in your preferred browser.

## Usage
Enter an event that you want to log to the daily scheduler and then click on the blue save button on the right. To delete a task, delete the text and click the save button again. Once saved, the data will persist even if the page is refreshed or closed.
